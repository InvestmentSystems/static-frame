# when summing, axis 0 sums rows (delivering labels of the axis 1)
# when summing, axis 1 sums columns (delivering labels of the axis 0)

# when iterating, axis 0 iters by column (delivering labels of axis 0, post apply has labels for axis 1)
# when iterating, axis 1 iters by row (delivering labels of axis 1)
# axis is axis along which we iterate: 0 iterates along

# when grouping, axis 0 iters groups selected by values in a column (groups are groups of rows)
# when grouping, axis 1 iters groups selected by values in a row (groups are groups of columns)

# pandas apply axis 0 applies func per columns (same sf's iter axis 0)
# pandas apply axis 1 applies func per row (same sf's iter axis 1)

# for axis 0, the function is "appled along the row axis", i.e, each function is given a series with axis 0 labels
